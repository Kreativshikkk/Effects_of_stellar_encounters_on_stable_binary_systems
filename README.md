Modelling and research of dynamical ejection scenario of runaway stars from stellar clusters. \
***Note:*** Correct work of this code depends on paths. Some data, such as simulations parameters, was transferred to the programs using Linux terminal \
This files can simulate N-body system by solving differential equations with Euler method; plot the dependence of each interaction outcome probability on semi-major axis (branching ratio)

# branching_ratios_illustrator.py
> This file plots final graphs (branching ratios) for each mass of objects

# condition_generator.py
> This file generates conditions for a current simulation

# modelling_with_energy.py
> This file receives initial conditions from the previous file; counts simulations

# simulation_illustrator.py
> This file shows object motion and energy graphs during simulation

# total_poster.pdf
> My poster devoted to this science work, which I presented at the All-Russian Scientific Conference Scientists of the Future and took third place
